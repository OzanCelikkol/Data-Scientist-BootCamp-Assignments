    "**(1)** Let's assume that you have World Bank data on financial, economic and social indicators for several countries. You want to measure the factors that affect the level of development in these countries. To this end, you decide to use per capita income as a proxy for the development level, which is defined as the national income divided by the population. You want to use some features in your dataset to predict per capita income. Is this task a classification or a regression task? Why? "

    "***To answer this question firstly we need to know what regression and classification are. Regression is a method that shows us how features related with each other by coefficients. On the hand, classification is a method that seperates discrete values by their certain differences. This certanity can be adjusted by the user. In this question our value is a continuous value so it must be a regression the method we should use. But if we seperate PCI values into some defined categories these values becomes discrete values and then we would be able to use classification method. ***"
